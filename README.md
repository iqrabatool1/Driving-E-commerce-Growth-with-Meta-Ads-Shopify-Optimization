Driving E-commerce Growth with Meta Ads & Shopify Optimization

Project Overview
This project showcases how I helped a client grow their Shopify store sales by combining Meta
Ads campaigns with Shopify optimization techniques.
The store was facing low sales and no proper ad strategy, which limited its growth potential.
Within one month, the campaign achieved the client’s sales target by driving more traffic, 
improving conversions, and optimizing the online store for better performance.

Business Problem
The client’s challenges were:
• Inconsistent sales (₨200K–₨300K per month).
• No advertising strategy to attract new customers.
• Poor Shopify optimization (SEO, payments, and email engagement not properly set up).
As a result, the store struggled to scale and capture its market potential.

Approach
To solve these problems, I implemented a step-by-step strategy:

Meta Ads Campaign
Designed and launched targeted ad campaigns.
Created custom audience segments.
Ran A/B tests on different creatives.
Set up conversion tracking to measure ROI.
Shopify Optimization

Installed and configured Smart SEO plugin to improve store visibility in search engines.
Set up EasySell plugin to streamline the payment process.
Structured the product catalog for smoother navigation and better customer experience.

Email Marketing
Implemented automated campaigns to re-engage existing customers.
Designed workflows for abandoned carts and promotions.
Performance Tracking & Adjustments
Regularly monitored ad performance.

Adjusted targeting and budget allocation for maximum returns.
Shared insights with the client for transparency and growth planning.

Tools Used
• Meta Ads Manager
• Shopify

Outcome
• Increased sales from an average of ₨200K–₨300K per month to ₨400K in one month.

• Improved customer engagement through email workflows.
• Enhanced store visibility and checkout process.

This project highlights how combining paid ads, SEO, Shopify optimization, and email marketing can create a strong growth strategy for e-commerce businesses.
